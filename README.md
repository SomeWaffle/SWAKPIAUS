# SWAKPIAUS - Scripts to install packages on Kubuntu - KDE Neon
SWAKPIAUS also known as Some Waffles Auto-Kubuntu Package Installer &amp; Apt Update Script, is a script library for KDE Neon & Kubuntu that gets updated depending on how new packages get. You get **5 choices** to choose from on how you want to install stuff, *you are the owner of your own operating system* and the scripts are just there to waste less time searching for packages all night long. No like seriously, *I had to do that and it was really unfunny*. So I decided to come up with scripts that will auto install apps for you, from Minimal to Massive. And the bigger the shell, the more the packages are gonna weigh on your system.

Before you call me out for checking the scripts and seeing mostly "echos" doesn't meant that time has been put into this, and I am not really a programmer but I know the tinest bit, so I can only do so much, maybe in the future ill turn these into actual packages you can just download using ```sudo apt install swakpiaus-minimal``` but that's if I get to understand linux a bit more.



## How do I use this awesome script that I just downloaded?
Download the script from the releases page or click here, open your file explorer, right click the file, then click open in Konsole(Terminal) or just CD your way into the script by opening console and doing ```cd ~/Downloads/ && bash SWAKPISUSS Medium Installation - Some Waffle.sh```, but it's your choice how you want to run the script, as long as you have root access to your account and can give it root to download and install stuff from the web, then it will work flawlessly.

> By the way, I am not responsible for your operating system if it fails or dies, do not install these scripts on Kubuntu 22 or lower, do it only on Kubuntu 23 or 24.04, KDE Neon is a bit different and I'm not too smart about it so you have to be cautious to not be running an old version of Ubuntu to not kill your system or screw up your whole package manager up. You are ok to send me Issues on [Issues](https://github.com/SomeWaffle/SWAKPIAUS/issues), where I will try my best to help, and maybe if I can, I will get a team to help me work on this project!
