# SWAKPIAUS - Scripts to install packages on Kubuntu - KDE Neon
SWAKPIAUS also known as Some Waffles Auto-Kubuntu Package Installer &amp; Apt Update Script, is a script library for KDE Neon & Kubuntu that gets updated depending on how new packages get. You get **5 choices** to choose from on how you want to install stuff, *you are the owner of your own operating system* and the scripts are just there to waste less time searching for packages all night long. No like seriously, *I had to do that and it was really unfunny*. So I decided to come up with scripts that will auto install apps for you, from Minimal to Massive. And the bigger the shell, the more the packages are gonna weigh on your system.

Before you call me out for checking the scripts and seeing mostly "echos" doesn't meant that time has been put into this, and I am not really a programmer but I know the tinest bit, so I can only do so much, maybe in the future ill turn these into actual packages you can just download using ```sudo apt install swakpiaus-minimal``` but that's if I get to understand linux a bit more.



## How do I use this awesome script that I just downloaded?
Download the script from the releases page or click here, open your file explorer, right click the file, then click open in Konsole(Terminal) or just CD your way into the script by opening console and doing ```cd ~/Downloads/ && bash SWAKPISUSS Medium Installation - Some Waffle.sh```, but it's your choice how you want to run the script, as long as you have root access to your account and can give it root to download and install stuff from the web, then it will work flawlessly.

> By the way, We am not responsible for your operating system if it fails or dies, do not install these scripts on Kubuntu 22 or lower, do it only on Kubuntu 23 or 24.04, KDE Neon is a bit different and I'm not too smart about it so you have to be cautious to not be running an old version of Ubuntu to not kill your system or screw up your whole package manager up. You are ok to send me Issues on [Issues](https://github.com/SomeWaffle/SWAKPIAUS/issues), where we will try my best to help, and maybe if we can, we will get a big team to help us work on this project!


## Can I copy this project?
Yes you can, under a circumstance, that you don't say that you have had the idea of that project, and still give us some credit. SWAKPIAUS was meant to be scripts that you can get for Kubuntu and KDE Neon so you could install multiple apps with once to many other categories so you could just run the script and start using your operating system. And if you would ever need more apps you could literally just install it with our scripts. Doesn't that just sound much better than having to go and search for a million different git pages or apps on the discover page just to find something you won't really need and that will probably clog your memory up so much you wasted a whole 5 gigabytes on apps you don't use? Well that's what we are here for, to make personalized scripts to install apps, no matter if it's flatpak, deb, appimage, apt... It will automatically install by itself without you having to search, then install this and that.

> Fun fact, every single one of our installation methods work as they should and they are completely automatic and no need for manual installation! What we mean basically is that the .deb files get installed by being downloaded to your computer, installed, then removed from your downloads folder to save space. And it doesn't matter what type it is... Apt, Flatpak, Deb, Appimage... All of that gets installed without any issues! As long as you have root permissions that is.


## Are there going to be more scripts for other platforms than Debian/Ubuntu?
Yes, in the future we will support installing apps on Arch, Mint, OpenSuse and others where you can still use our scripts, no matter where your operating system lands in the linux distro world. Sure our scripts might be basic and that you could do it all in a terminal or make your own, but that doesn't mean that ours are bad. We customize our installers as much as possible to make it as user friendly as we possibly can so many people will use our scripts instead of searching for millions of apps just to find the ones they do not need AT ALL.


## Will there be a UI version without having to find the right script?
Yes there will be indeed a UI version one day where you can click what kind of category or what kind of apps you want to install. However, with the current knowledge and the power of this team, we are not intelligent enough to program a whole UI for you to just be moving in.
